How we will balance the totalSupply as we have burning and minting both.. 
	Should we keep proportional minting based on how much buds are burned.. 
	So is it going to be like undetermined supply of tokens..??
		-- Mintable
		-- burnable
		-- proportional minting

What about NFTs --
	- Supply
	- minting logic - capped - 999 each chain - 20% narcs 80% farmers
	- burning logic - Farmers not burnable, Narcs not burnable, other two burnable
    - Token ids - to avoid collision across chains we will not be sequqntial
        - uint256 tokenId = Keccak256(abi.encode(chainName+sequenceNumber))

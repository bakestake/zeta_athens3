# Omni-Chain Game Contracts

Welcome to the Omni-Chain Game Contracts repository! This project harnesses the latest advancements in Solidity to create an innovative, private, and secure gaming experience. Our game introduces groundbreaking features like omni-chain staking, cross-chain raids, dynamic staking rewards, and booster NFTs. Below, we provide a high-level overview of the project's key aspects.

## Features

- **Omni-Chain Staking:** Stake your assets across multiple blockchain networks to earn rewards.
- **Cross-Chain Raids:** Use NFTs to launch attacks on other chains' staking pools, enhancing the competitive aspect of the game.
- **Dynamic Staking Rewards:** Earn rewards based on the saturation of the chain you are staking on, ensuring fair and balanced gameplay.
- **Booster NFTs:** Increase your staking rewards with unique booster NFTs, adding a strategic layer to the game.

## Getting Started

As our project is currently in private development, the codebase is not available for public cloning. We aim to keep this innovative use-case confidential until the official launch. However, once the project is live, we will provide details of contract functionality, which do not expose the game to malicious attacks.

Stay tuned for updates on our official website and social media channels for information about the launch date and access to the codebase.

## Usage

Upon launch, you will find comprehensive usage instructions and API documentation in the project's official documentation. We will provide detailed guides on how to interact with the contracts and make the most of the game's features.

## Contributing

While we're not accepting external contributions at this stage due to the private nature of the project, we appreciate your interest and support. After the official launch of MVP, we will consider contributions and collaborations to further enhance the project.

## License

The Omni-Chain Game Contracts are protected under a proprietary license until the official launch date. After the launch, we will provide licensing details that align with our open-source strategy.
